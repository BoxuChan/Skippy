# Skippy
## _"So that you never have to hear Gaius yap again."_

Are you tired of having to go through **Main Scenario Roulettes** while just sitting there, having to read all of that yap from NPCs that don't especially matter for the 1,000,000,000th time? You've come to the right place.

**Skippy** is a plugin that allows you to do just that. Say goodbye to those _"unskippable"_ cutscenes, by, that's right, __skipping them__.
However, if you queue with the plugin on while even one member of your party doesn't have it installed, you will end up just sit there waiting in the cage until they are done with their cutscene, just like every instance's starting cutscene making the party unable to start early, ensuring that everyone is ready.
