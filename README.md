# Skippy
## _"So that you never have to hear Gaius yap again."_

Have you gone tired of having to go through **Main Scenario Quest Roulettes** and just sitting there having to read for the 1,000,000,000th time, all of that yap from NPCs that don't especially matter ; or that you haven't even seen in months or even years? You've come to the right place.

**Skippy** is a plugin that allows you to do just that. Say goodbye to those _"unskippable"_ cutscenes, by doing just that, __skipping them__.
There sadly is a twist to it, though if you enjoy just not having the yap in your ears, it remains enjoyable to an extent.
